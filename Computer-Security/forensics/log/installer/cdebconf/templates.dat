Description: Installer components to load:
Extended_description: All components of the installer needed to complete the install will be loaded automatically and are not listed here. Some other (optional) installer components are shown below. They are probably not necessary, but may be interesting to some users.\n\nNote that if you select a component that requires others, those components will also be loaded.

Type: multiselect
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Description: Installer components to load:
Extended_description: To save memory, only components that are certainly needed for an install are selected by default. The other installer components are not all necessary for a basic install, but you may need some of them, especially certain kernel modules, so look through the list carefully and select the components you need.\n\nNote that if you select a component that requires others, those components will also be loaded.

Name: anna/install_failed
Type: error
Description: Failed to load installer component
Extended_description: Loading ${PACKAGE} failed for unknown reasons. Aborting.

Name: anna/no_kernel_modules
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Continue the install without loading kernel modules?
Extended_description: No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between the kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version available in the archive.\n\nIf you're installing from a mirror, you can work around this problem by choosing to install a different version of Debian. The install will probably fail to work if you continue without kernel modules.

Extended_description: Debian has two services that provide updates to releases: security and volatile.\n\nSecurity updates help to keep your system secured against attacks. Enabling this service is strongly recommended.\n\nVolatile updates provide more current versions for software that changes relatively frequently and where not having the latest version could reduce the usability of the software. An example is the virus signatures for a virus scanner. This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.

Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
Extended_description: The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the root file system. It therefore needs to contain all drivers and supporting programs required to do that.\n\nA generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so large that some bootloaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the smaller targeted initrd there is a very small chance that not all needed drivers are included.

Extended_description: You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive, or even to a floppy.\n\nThe device can be specified using GRUB's "(hdn,m)" notation, or as a device in /dev. Below are some examples:\n - "(hd0)" or "/dev/hda" will install GRUB to the master boot record\n   of your first hard drive (IDE);\n - "(hd0,1)" or "/dev/hda2" will use the second partition of your\n   first IDE drive;\n - "(hd2,4)" or "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of\n   your third drive (SCSI here);\n - "(fd0)" or "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard drive.\n\nWarning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.

Extended_description: The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to start any menu entry without entering the password.\n\nIf you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

Extended_description: You are trying to set the bootable flag on a logical partition. The bootable flag is generally only useful on primary partitions, so setting it on logical partitions is normally discouraged. Some BIOS versions are known to fail to boot if there is no bootable primary partition.\n\nHowever, if you are sure that your BIOS does not have this problem, or if you are using a custom boot manager that pays attention to bootable logical partitions, then setting this flag may make sense.

Description: In order to start your new system, a so called boot loader is used.  It can be installed either in the master boot record of the first hard disk, or in a partition.  When the boot loader is installed in a partition, you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.

Name: partman-target/arch_help/ia64
Type: text
Description: In order to start your new system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI partition has a FAT16 file system formatted on it and the bootable flag set. Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of the same hard disk that holds the root file system.

Extended_description: Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which partition(s) will be used for the installation.\n\nSelect a free space to create partitions in it.\n\nSelect a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty partition table.\n\nSelect a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used. At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as "virtual memory".\n\nWhen the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.\n\nIn general you will want to format the partition with a newly created file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".\n\n${ARCHITECTURE_HELP}

Extended_description: It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities, such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for those day-to-day tasks.\n\nNote that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an username, like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.

Extended_description: You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries, or a word that could be easily associated with you.\n\nA good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.\n\nNote that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.

Any of these could be made to work:\n  intra		[for example.com, these three are equivalent]\n  intra.example.com\n  http://intra.example.com/d-i/./lenny/preseed.cfg\n  http://192.168.0.1/~phil/test47.txt\n  floppy://preseed.cfg\n  file:///hd-media/kiosk/./preseed.cfg\n\nFor fully automated installs, preseed/url should itself be preseeded (via kernel command line, DHCP, or syslinux.cfg on customised media)\n\nSee http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed for inspiration.
