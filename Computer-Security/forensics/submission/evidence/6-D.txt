		<strong>50. RE: American Gladiators' Blaster Is Most Powerful Nerf Gun Ever: Hands-on First Look</strong><br />
		Oh my dear poster #3... I feel pity for you.  Let children be children.  It is up to us adults to teach our kids the difference between true-life violence and the wonderful world of make believe.  Oh to have those carefree days of unihibited fun back.  Those who commit acts of violence are not the children who we watch over as they make believe war scenarios.  Rather, they are the children who are sheltered, bullied and abused.  The most powerful tool us big kids have is TALKING to our children.  They are so much smarter than you think...<br /><br />

		It's actually an awfully underpowered gun, and a tough one to casually mod. Very over-rated, but still fun.<br /><br />

		definately not the most powerful or fastest.....the most powerful ones are the 90's models going at 75ft unmodded :) also this gun jams alot.Its basicly just a rip off<br /><br />

		Actually, there are not any problems with it when I use it... See, the reason it jams is because when you load it with the ammo box, you're loading it from the side closest to the gun, instead of loading it from the other side like in the instructions. (Yep, I saved the instructions.) When you do that, you have to fold it over to get it into the wheels. However, when you go to rapid-fire it, the fold has to kind of "roll" over into the wheels, but the ammo box door, held in place by the barrel door, is in the way. In wheels vs. door, door wins, & the wheels can't roll the next round through, or, in other words, it jams. However, fixing it is quite easy. You just load it from the other side. Also, you can work the gun without the ammo box's door- just take it off the ammo box & use the ammo box without it. On manual, this gun is actually better than the longshot, & on rapid it is definitely the best gun ever. Yes, that includes the rapid 20 (actually, it's a less rapid shot, but it has belts so you don't have to reload every single dart back into the barrel). Well, the batteries are kind of expensive, but it is DEFINITELY worth it. I wouldn't enter a nerf fight without it.<br /><br />

		My husband just bought the new Blaster N-strike vulcanEBF-25 it sucks for one thing it is not worth 50.00 canadian funds. The cartriges get stuck when firing the gun and then to make matters worse me or my husband has to open the cartridge container to get the gun firing again because my 8 year old son does not have enough strength to open it for that matter neither do I.And then on top of that we have to buy 6 D batteries that cost 20.00 for the piece of crap to make that awful noise and to get stuck. This product is worth 10.00 and we will  not be buying anymore of your products!<br /><br />
