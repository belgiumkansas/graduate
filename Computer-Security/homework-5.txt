# Problem 1

1a. The eavesdropper doesn't know the private session key so they cannot decrypt the traffic.

1b. By impersonating the site you are trying to reach a man in the middle can create their own private key with you and another with the actual server. But this can easily be thwarted by adding a self signed certificate directly and not accepting and other certificates.

1c. i. leaves site open to man in the middle attacks ii. Provides protection against active and passive attacks so is most secure


# Problem 2

2a. Injecting the victims username into the form

2b. send an e-mail to the desired user with a link that will execute the desired code when they click it

2c. 

# Problem 3

3a. This prevents the attacker from guessing what the canary

3b. The attacker can run  the same attack until they find the canary value. 0 is a null value so often it will often stop the stack overflow attack

3c. a function's argument can be exploited, or the frame pointer can be altered and overwritten

# Problem 4

4a. Because you are placing unauthorized code onto someone else's system you are in fact breaking the law

4b. If it could prevent far greater damage or if you have permission. For example if a Stuxnet type worm was attacking a nuclear reactor releasing an "anti" worm that could save the plant would be justified.
